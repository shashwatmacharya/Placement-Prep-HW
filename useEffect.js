/* 
The useEffect hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. 
It is used to handle tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually interacting with the DOM. 
The useEffect hook is executed after the component has rendered, 
and it can be used to manage the lifecycle of the component.

We use the useEffect hook to update the document title whenever the count value changes. 
The useEffect hook takes two arguments: a callback function and a dependencies array.
